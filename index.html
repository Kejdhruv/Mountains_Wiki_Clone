          A mountain is an elevated portion of the <U>Earth's Crust </U> <sub> <a href=https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/crust/ target="main" > [1] </a> </sub>, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed <u>bedrock </u><sub><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedrock target='main'> [2] </a></sub>. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited <U>summit area</U><sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit target='main'>[3] </a></sub>, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.
        <br>
        

Mountains are formed through <u> tectonic forces</u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics target = 'main '> [4] </a></sub>, erosion, or volcanism,which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through <u>slumping </u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slump_(geology) target = "main "> [5] </a></sub>and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.
        <br>
        

High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and <u> logging</u><sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging target='main '> [6] </a></sub>, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing.
        <br> 

The highest mountain on Earth is <u>Mount Everest</u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest target='main' > [7] </a></sub>in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft) <br>

          GEOLOGY 
        </h4>
       <P>
         There are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move,<u> crumple</u><sub> <a href=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/crumple target= ' main ' > [8] </a> </sub>, and dive. <u>Compressional forces </u> <sub> <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressive_strength > [9] </a></sub>, <u>isostatic uplift </u> <sub> <a href=https://homework.study.com/explanation/what-is-isostatic-uplift.html target="main" > [10]</a> </sub>and intrusion of<u> igneous matter </u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock target='main ' > [11] </a></sub> forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity. <BR>

         <LI> <h5> Volcanos  </h5>
          
          <p>  Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km (60 mi), melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a <u > stratovolcano </u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratovolcano target = "main "> [12] </a></sub>. Examples of volcanoes include <i>Mount Fuji</i> in Japan and <i>Mount Pinatubo</i> in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as <i>Navajo Mountain</i> in the US.<br>

          </p> </LI>
         <LI> <h5> Fold Mountains </h5>
         <p>Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust "floats" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the<u> mantle </u> <sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) target= "main" > [13]</a> </sub>. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be<u> recumbent </u> <sub> <a href=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/recumbent target='main' > [14] </a></sub>and overturned folds. The <i>Balkan Mountains </i> and the <i>Jura Mountains </i>are examples of fold mountains. <br>

         </LI>   </p>
    <LI> <h5>Block mountains</h5>
          <p>Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a plane where rocks have moved past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain. The uplifted blocks are block mountains or <U> horsts</U> <sub><A href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_(geology) target = 'main ' > [15] </A></sub>. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, <i>the Vosges</i> and <i>Rhine valley</i>,and <i>the Basin and Range Province of Western North America</i>. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned. <br>

    </LI> <LI> <h5>Erosion</h5>
          <p>
            During and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice, and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves.: 160  Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge arêtes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the <i>Catskills </i>, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.

          <h4>Climate </h4>
        <p>Climate in the mountains becomes colder at high elevations, due to an interaction between radiation and <u>convection</u> <sub> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection target= "main " > [16] </a></sub>. Sunlight in the visible<u> spectrum </u> <sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum target="main "> [17] </a> </sub>hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the <u>greenhouse</u> <sub> <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect target='main '> </a></sub> effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly 333 K (60 °C; 140 °F), and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.<br>

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to  equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an <u>adiabatic process </u> <sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_process target='main'> [18] </a> </sub>, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature dependence. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometre (or 5.4 °F (3.0 °C) per 1000 feet) of altitude.<br> 

The presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 °C per kilometre or 3 °F (1.7 °C) per 1000 feet) The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location. Therefore, moving up 100 m (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometres (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the nearest pole.[10]: 15  This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans (such as the <i>Arctic Ocean</i>) can drastically modify the climate. As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase.: <br> 

The effect of the climate on the ecology at an elevation can be largely captured through a combination of amount of precipitation, and the <u> biotemperature</u> <sub> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdridge_life_zones target='main' 
 > [19] </a></sub>, as described by <i>Leslie Holdridge </i>in 1947. Biotemperature is the mean temperature; all temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) are considered to be 0 °C. When the temperature is below 0 °C, plants are dormant, so the exact temperature is unimportant. The peaks of mountains with permanent snow can have a biotemperature below 1.5 °C (34.7 °F). <br>
